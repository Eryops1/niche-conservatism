The intention of this script is to:
1) Extract large quantities of species occurrence data for many species from BIEN-R
2) Plot species occurrence points on various biome maps and analyze the occurrence distribution for niche catagorization
3) Connect niche specified species to a plant kingdom phylogenetic tree and analyze clusteredness

BIEN-R occurrence points will be extracted for species from Kew Plants Of The World speices lists, containing huge numbers of species names. For data protection purposes, these datasheets will not be posted here at this point. For more information on data structure and variable definitions contact me personally through email (201505410@post.au.dk) or see test_data (read below).

In addition to the main script (niche_conservatism_analysis) an additional test-script (niche_conservatism_test) is included together with a test datasheet of only a few species (test_data) for quick code testing and reviewing on any computer.

More README information on shapefiles and plant kingdom phyologenetic tree will follow soon...
